Therefore, we are looking to provide that space for performers that desire the experience and to develop their art! Whether it is your FIRST performance ever, or you've been steadily developing your acts, this is the space for you! If you aren't chosen for a show right away, we will provide feedback & guidance on act development and/or keep you in the talent pool for future shows. The goal is to get as many folks on stage that want to be! ",
